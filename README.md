** Plagiarism Detector **

*********************************************************************************************

*This is a individual course project - the main goal of this project is to detect the plagiarism between two given files
one of the requirement of this porject is to produce the results accurately and time required for 500MB file size results should 
not exceed more than 5 seconds.*

*If there is plagiarism between two given files then the code will return 1 indicating that the two files are plagiarised.
and it will return 0 if there is no plagiarism between two files.*

*Algorithms useed: String Pattern Matching algorithms, Rabin Karp pattern amtching algorithm, Cosine Similarity*

*Outcome: I was able to meet the project requirements that the algorithm was able to produce the results for 500 MB files in 5 seconds
and the accuracy is 93%*
